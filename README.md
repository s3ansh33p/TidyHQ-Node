# TidyHQ API for NodeJS

This is a NodeJS wrapper for the TidyHQ API. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
The [ComSSA ticketing system](https://github.com/s3ansh33p/TidyHQ-App) will be built on top of this API, though other applications may find it useful.

## Support for V2 API

There is now a client.V2 class which is a wrapper for the V2 API. This is still a work in progress, and routes on the V1 API will still be accessible with client.Events, client.Contacts, etc.
