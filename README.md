# TidyHQ API for NodeJS

This is a NodeJS wrapper for the TidyHQ API. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
Refer to the [TidyHQ V1 API Documentation](https://dev.tidyhq.com/) and [TidyHQ V2 API Documentation](https://tidyhq.readme.io/).

## Support for V2 API

There is now a client.V2 class which is a wrapper for the V2 API. This is still a work in progress, and routes on the V1 API will still be accessible with client.Events, client.Contacts, etc.
